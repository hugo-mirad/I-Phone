20-11
freshly starting from 19-11\Car-FinderUniversal-0 version. So starting with login view controller again.

completed loginviewcontroller and registerviewcontroller. Actually there was a problem in loginviewcontroller. When I go to registerviewcontroller and comeback to login view controller, it was crashing. This was because, I was adding subviews to scrollview instead of self.view. (also giving constraints based on scrollview)

now I am adding subviews to self.view and the problem is rectified. (now giving contraints based on self.view) in loginviewcontroller.

How to automatically make fname, lname resize in rotation to equal widths:
1. horizontal spacing b/w fname, lname (x pos)
2. align bottoms of fname, lname (y pos)
3. spacing b/w lname and edge of container (so that textfields do not expand at runtime and go beyond bounds)
4. fname, lname equal widths

detailviewforseller partially
send email to sellerr is nto complete

remove scrolling in sendemailtoseller webview

height of email in detailview for seller should be increased. g in "datumglobal" is getting cut off from bottom. Similary 'y' is getting cut off in 'validity' in package details screen.

phone number is moved from its actual place to beside of thumbnail in mylistdetailview (iPad)
    
description is not occupying full in mylistdetailview. So check this condition for detailviewforseller

in registration info: I am not able to use autolayout for statepicker. If I use it, picker is empty though clicking on it is selecting differnt values(as seen in console)

10. remove
@property(strong,nonatomic) UIImageView *activityImageView;
@property(strong,nonatomic) UIImage *showActivityViewerImage;
@property(strong,nonatomic) UIActivityIndicatorView *activityWheel;

from all except common methods and see
